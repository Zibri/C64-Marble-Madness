# To rebuild the original protected disk (and obtain a clean master)

Copy this d64 on a floppy disk.   
<a href="https://github.com/Zibri/C64-Marble-Madness/raw/main/MarbleMadness_Master.d64">Marble Madness D64</a>   

Then insert disk into the drive and:

<a href="https://github.com/Zibri/C64-Marble-Madness/raw/main/WP.PRG">LOAD"WP",8</a>   

RUN

WP.PRG will write the protection track on track #2.

# Alternatevely, to SKIP the protection:

Then insert disk into the drive and:

<a href="https://github.com/Zibri/C64-Marble-Madness/raw/main/SP.PRG">LOAD"SP",8</a>   

RUN

# Result

The result is a perfect master or a unprotected copy of Marble Madness and 100% working as the original.

Mission accomplished.
